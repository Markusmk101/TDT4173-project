# TDT4173-project

## Overview:

- fpl_data.csv is the dataset to build the models.
- Data.ipynb fetches and preprocesses the data and then saves the data in the file called fpl_data.csv.
- Models.ipynb defines and builds the models based on fpl_data.csv, as well as evaluating and comparing the models.


## Run code:

#### If you want to run the data preprocessing:
1. Delete the file fpl_data.csv.
2. Run Data.ipynb. This will create a new file called fpl_data.csv. Make sure this is placed in the same directory as the Models.ipynb file.
   - Note: This file takes some time to run. Approximately 1 hour on a personal computer. 
   - Make sure to run the cells in the given chronological order.
   - Ignore the warnings.

#### Or skip directly to the model training, as we have already uploaded fpl_data.csv to save you the time:
1. Run Models.ipynb.
   - Make sure to run the cells in the given chronological order.

Both the ipynb files shold be sufficent commented for you to follow the code.
